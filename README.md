# 3D Printed Master Keys
A work in progress list of Master Keys, attached with STL files for 3D printing

This is a work in progress list of Master Keys. Currently these keys are being found by my own research into the topic. Feel free to leave suggestions and add infromation of keys not on this list


Usefull Websites/Tools:

- [Keygen.co](www.keygen.co) - Website for generating STL files for keys based on bitting code
- [Keyspace](https://ggrsecurity.com/personal/~bgraydon/keyspace/) - Website for calculating the master key for a unqiue system [github](https://github.com/search?p=3&q=master+key&type=Repositories)
- [Elevatorpedia](https://elevation.fandom.com/wiki/Elevator_keys) - Website with a list of all master key's for each different elevator brand
- [TSA Keys](https://github.com/Xyl2k/TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys) -Github containing the STL files for TSA Master Keys - can also be found in TSA_keys folder
